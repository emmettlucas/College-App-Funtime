# College-App-Funtime
A program in which the user plays as me, Emmett Lucas, and goes through levels showing off stuff for college admissions offices

Emmett Lucas Program Func Spec

Feature Overview:

     An Android-based side-scrolling platformer, which will also serve as my college application essay (of course I will also write a paper one as backup). The user plays as me, Emmett Lucas, and the end goal of the game is to get to college. The user will be walked through all of the things for me that would be found in a application essay, in a visual form with some text.

MVP:

    A basic run through hitting all the points that would be in a college essay. In other words, a relatively complete “Easy/Quick Mode” [see below for more details] The character should look like me, be moveable without glitches with the right, left, and jump buttons, be able to experience every point/essay feature, and be able to reach an end.

Justification:

     This is a compelling project because it will help differentiate myself from other applicants during the college application process and might make me more likely to get into a good college.

Scenarios:

    -Easy/Quick Mode button on menu (for those without time, patience or problem solving skills) this takes the user on an almost autopiloted journey through the parts of the college application.
    -Game Mode on menu, which takes the user through a more gamelike, fleshed out, and difficult version of the app.
    -User can use the arrow buttons on the left side of the screen to move left and right, and can use the rightmost button on the right side to jump
    -User can use the button next to the jump button to perform any special action, like interact with objects or use a powerup
    -Main menu/title page with clickable play, and settings buttons
    -Play button opens new page where the user can choose between Easy/Quick Mode and Normal/Game Mode
    -Settings opens new page with volume and a few other options  
    -Game over screen which then returns user to main menu or restarts the level
    -Player can jump on things (working gravity and collision detection)
    -Player can interact with essay points/features
    -In game mode, player can kill enemies and interact with GUI in creative but set ways
    -Player is able to reach an end of the game
    -Progress HUD on top of screen as well as settings and pause button

Goals:

    I hope to achieve a smooth, coherent and lagless experience that the user can get through it in one relatively short sitting (at least for the Quick Mode), and to have engaging and creative levels for the game mode. I also hope to have some interesting camera and game mechanics throughout the game.

Non-Goals:

    -Trump, a sloth, or a piece of uncooked rice as main character
    -Normal mario-like platformer game to be uploaded to Google Play
    -“My (first) project will be an Android-based side-scrolling platformer in which the user plays as [ ]. It will ideally have interesting camera and game mechanics. By interesting camera mechanics I mean not keeping the character in the middle of the screen the whole game, making it have to “catch up” a little if you start moving more or less quickly or in a different direction, and return to center screen while the player is idle. Some game mechanics I may incorporate are unconventional use of the HUD, like the character on screen may be able or required to interact with it, also various items to collect which give the user (temporary) abilities, and different ways that the user has to move the character depending on the level. I see this to be a compelling project that people will want to play because... “
